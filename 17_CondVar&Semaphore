## Conditional Variables->
## Semaphores-> 

are synchronization tools commonly used to manage access to shared resources among multiple threads. Here’s how they work and differ in synchronizing threads:

## 1. Conditional Variables->

Conditional variables allow threads to wait until a certain condition is met. They are often used alongside mutexes (locks) to allow threads to communicate about the state of a shared resource.

## Key Points:

Wait and Signal: Threads can wait on a condition, and once the condition is met, another thread can signal (notify) them to continue.

Example: In a producer-consumer scenario, the consumer thread can wait on a condition until there is data to consume, and the producer thread signals the condition once data is available.

## Operations:

wait(): Puts the thread to sleep until another thread signals that the condition has changed.

signal() or notify(): Wakes one or more threads waiting on the condition.

## 2. Semaphores

A semaphore is a signaling mechanism that uses counters to manage access to shared resources. Semaphores can control a set number of threads allowed to access the critical section (e.g., the resource) simultaneously.

## Key Points

Types of Semaphores:

Binary Semaphore: Acts as a simple lock, allowing only one thread at a time.

Counting Semaphore: Manages a specified number of concurrent threads, useful for managing limited resources (like connections).
Example: In a parking garage with limited spots, a semaphore could allow only a set number of cars in, blocking others until a spot is free.

## Operations:

wait() (or P()): Decreases the semaphore count. If the count reaches zero, threads must wait.

signal() (or V()): Increases the semaphore count, allowing a waiting thread to proceed if resources are available.

## Comparison in Synchronization

Conditional Variables are ideal when threads need to wait for specific conditions and require mutual exclusion with mutex locks.
Semaphores manage access to resources, especially when there’s a limit on how many threads can access them at once, making them flexible for resource control.


In summary, conditional variables are event-based and work with mutexes, while semaphores provide count-based control, both ensuring synchronized, orderly access to shared resources among threads.

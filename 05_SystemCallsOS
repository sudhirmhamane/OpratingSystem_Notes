##  System Calls:

    System calls is implemented by the C.

    A System call is a mechanism using which the user program can request a service from the kerenal for which it does not have the permission to perform.

    System Call is the only way through which the a process can go into the kernel mode to the user mode.


    By using the system calls the switching happens between the user mode and kernal mode.

    It is way to communicate the user space to the kernal to do some work from the hardware through the kernal.

## How the apps interact with the kernel?

    Using the System calls.

    Ex: Mkdir
        Mkdir indirectly calls the kernal and asked the file magnt. module to crate a new directory.

        Mkdir is just wrapper of the system calls.

        Mkdir interacts with kernel using the system calls.
    
    Ex: Creating a process.

        User excute a process from the user space

        Get the system call

        excute system call to ceate process 

        return to user space.

    Transition from the user mode to kernel mode is due to the software interrupts.

## Types of the System Calls->

    1. Process Control
        process end
        process abort
        load,execute
        create,delete
    2. File Management
        Create,Deleting
        open,close
        write,read
        get file attribute
        set file attribute
    3. Device Management
        Request,release Device
        read,write,reposition
    4. Infromation Maintainance
        get time,date
        ser time,date
        get device attribute
        set device attribute
    5.  Information Maintinance
    6.  Communication Management

## Segmentation->

Segmentation is a memory management technique that divides a process's memory into variable-sized sections called segments, based on the logical divisions in the program, such as code, data, and stack. Unlike paging, which uses fixed-size pages, segmentation is based on the logical structure of the program, making each segment size different.

Each segment is assigned a segment number and a segment offset, and the OS keeps a segment table to map each segment to its location in physical memory.

## Key Points of Segmentation

Logical Grouping: Memory is divided based on logical segments, which correspond to different parts of the program, like functions, arrays, etc.

Variable Size: Segments are of different sizes depending on the memory needs of each program section.

Segment Table: Each process has a segment table that keeps track of the starting address and length of each segment in memory.

Protection and Sharing: Allows setting access permissions per segment and sharing specific segments with other processes (e.g., shared code segments).

## Benefits of Segmentation

No Internal Fragmentation: Memory is allocated only as much as needed for each segment, so there is less wasted space.

Better Logical Representation: Since segments correspond to logical parts of the program, they make memory allocation more intuitive.

## Drawbacks of Segmentation

External Fragmentation: Variable-sized segments can create small free memory gaps, leading to external fragmentation.

Complexity: Managing variable-sized segments and segment tables adds complexity to the OS.

Example
A program with a code segment (10 KB), a data segment (15 KB), and a stack segment (5 KB) would have three segments with different sizes. Each segment is loaded into a separate memory location.

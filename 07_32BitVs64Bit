## 32Bit->

32Bit allocate the 2^31 address.

in the 32Bit Os the Addresable spaces is very less compared to the 64Bit.

In the 32BIt the resource user are very less.

performance wise it not better than the 64Bit OS.

## 64Bit->

It having more addresable space 2^63.

The resource usage is more comapred to the 32Bit.

It is having more compatibility.

Better Graphic performance is there.

64Bit allocate the 2^63 address

1 byte = 8 bit

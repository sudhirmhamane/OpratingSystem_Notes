## Topic : What happens When we turn on the computer?

## BOIS:(Basic Input Output System)

    BIOS is traditional firmware used to start the computer when the turn on it.

    It initalize the hardware,chacking everything is working and then load the OS from the hard disk.

    It is stored on a small chip on the motherboard.

## UEFI:(Unified Extensible firmware InterFace)

    It is the modern replacement of the Bios.

    It does the same work as the Bios but with more advanced features.

    UEFI Supports a graphical interface larger hard drives,Faster Booting and the Better Security.

    it is also stored in the motherbord but offers a more user friendly setup.
    5 Step Process:

    Step1: Power ON
       In this step the system button is swich on.
       Firstiy Mother Bord and the HardDisk Get the power. 

    Step2: CPU Loads the Bios or the UEFI:
        Bios is the the a small program which is the not OS which is stored in the Bios cheaps.

        the UEFI is the advance version of the Bios.

        1.CPU intialize
        2.After the cpu initalization the it goes to the Bios cheap.
    Step3.Bios and UEFI runs tests and  initiate hardware.
            3.1) Bios loads some settings from a memory area which is backed by the CMOS Battery.
            3.2)Program loads woith setting.
    4.Bios and UEFI hands off to the Boot Device.

        Boot Devices are the Disk, CD, USB device.

        Boot Loader it is a program when it is executed it active the OS.

        In the MBR (master Boot record) in which the boot loader is avilable.

        But Nowdays the UEFI uses the EFI
        It create a partition in disk where the Boot loader is present.

    5. Boot loader loads the Full OS.

        in the 4th step the Bios handeled the operation from onwards the Boot loader Operates.

# Free Space Management in Operating Systems->

The Operating System (OS) manages free space in memory to ensure efficient allocation to new processes and avoid fragmentation. It tracks available memory and reallocates it as processes complete or new ones start. Here are the primary 

methods used:

Bitmap or Bit Vector:

The memory is divided into fixed-size blocks, each represented by a bit (0 for free, 1 for occupied).
Helps in locating and allocating free memory blocks but can consume additional memory for storage.

Linked List (Free List):

A linked list maintains records of free memory blocks with pointers, linking free spaces.
Allows dynamic memory allocation with variable-sized memory requests.

Free Space Indexing:

Maintains a table or an index of free memory spaces.
Efficient for locating free memory quickly but needs frequent updating.

Buddy System:

Divides memory into blocks of sizes that are powers of 2, called "buddies."
Combines or splits buddies as needed, helping reduce fragmentation.

Memory Compaction:

Moves processes in memory to consolidate free space, making large contiguous blocks available.
Primarily used when external fragmentation occurs.

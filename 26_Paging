# Paging

Paging is a memory management scheme in an operating system (OS) that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It divides both physical memory and logical memory (the memory seen by a process) into fixed-size blocks called pages and frames, respectively.

Here's how it works:

Logical Memory Pages: The OS divides the logical address space (program memory) of a process into fixed-sized blocks called pages.

Physical Memory Frames: The OS divides the physical memory into blocks of the same size as pages, called frames.

Mapping Pages to Frames: When a process needs memory, its pages are mapped to available frames using a page table. This allows a process's pages to be loaded anywhere in memory, which avoids fragmentation and makes memory usage more flexible.

Page Table: Each process has a page table that keeps track of where its pages are located in the physical memory. The page table maps each page in the logical memory to a specific frame in the physical memory.

# Key Benefits of Paging

Avoids External Fragmentation: Memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks, so memory can be used efficiently without external fragmentation.

Flexibility in Memory Allocation: Pages can be placed anywhere in physical memory, enabling more efficient use of available memory.

# Key Terms

Page Fault: Occurs when a requested page is not in memory. The OS then loads it from secondary storage (like a hard drive) into a free frame in memory.

Frame: A fixed-size block in physical memory.

Example
If a process needs 10 KB of memory and each page/frame is 1 KB, the process will have 10 pages mapped to 10 frames.

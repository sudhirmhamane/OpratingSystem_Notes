## Process State->

Process state is the life cycle from the process Generation to the Termination.

    1> New State->
        New state is the when the program is converting into the process.
    
    2> Ready State->
        The Ready State is when the Process is created and the process is taken to the memory.

        It is like the Ready Queue.
    
    3> Running State->

        Running state is that the process get the cpu from the ready state and it is executing.
    
    4> Waiting State->

        when the proces in the running state the i/o opration comes so then the process goes to the waiting state.
    
    5> Terminated State:
        in this State the process is finish and execuated.


## Two Types of Schedular->

    1> Job Schedular(LTS)
        Job Schedular pecke the process fro the pule and put the process in the ready state.

        the idea time of the this schedular is more and it not operated in the high frequency.

    2> CPU Schedular(STS)
        From the ready stete to the runnig state the CPU schedular do that thing.

        CPU is called as the shot term schedular beacuse the the idea time between this is very less and it oprate on the high frequency.

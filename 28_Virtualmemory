## Virtual Memory->

Virtual Memory is a memory management technique used by operating systems to provide an "idealized abstraction" of the storage resources that allows a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. This process creates the illusion of a larger amount of RAM than what is physically available.

Key Concepts of Virtual Memory

Abstraction: Virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than is physically available on the system by abstracting the memory address space. Each process has its own virtual address space.

Paging and Segmentation: Virtual memory systems typically use paging or segmentation to manage memory. Paging divides the virtual memory into fixed-size blocks, while segmentation divides it into variable-sized segments.

Page File/Swap Space: When the physical memory is full, the operating system moves inactive pages of memory to a reserved space on the disk called the page file or swap space. This frees up RAM for active processes.

Demand Paging: Virtual memory can use demand paging, where pages are loaded into RAM only when they are needed, reducing the initial loading time of a program.

Page Fault: When a program accesses a page that is not in physical memory, a page fault occurs, prompting the operating system to load the required page from the disk into RAM.

Benefits of Virtual Memory

Increased Memory Space: Allows more applications to run concurrently by utilizing disk space as additional memory.

Isolation and Protection: Each process operates in its own virtual address space, providing better isolation and protection from other processes.

Efficient Use of Memory: Helps manage memory more efficiently by loading only the necessary parts of programs.

Drawbacks of Virtual Memory

Performance Overhead: Excessive paging (swapping data in and out of disk) can lead to performance degradation, known as thrashing.

Disk Access Speed: Accessing data from disk is significantly slower than accessing it from RAM.

Example
If a computer has 8 GB of physical RAM but uses virtual memory, it can simulate having 16 GB of RAM by utilizing a portion of the hard drive as virtual memory.
